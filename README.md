# Optimisation-du-temps-d-attente-l-Alpe-d-Huez

This repository aims at calculating an itinerary for people skiing in Alpe d'Huez station in order to avoid the waiting time in the file for the gondola. 
This idea appeared to me during my holidays at Alpe d'Huez when I had to wait for a long time to take the gondola. 
Of course the data of waiting time etc. are simulated because I don't have the real ones from the Alpe d'Huez but it shows that it can be done.
